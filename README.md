# 🔐 Secure File Sharing System – Future Interns Task 3

This repository contains the completed work for *Task 3* of my Cybersecurity Internship under **Future Interns**. In this project, I built a simple yet secure file sharing system where users can upload and download files, and all files are encrypted using **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**. This task simulated real-world work in industries like healthcare or legal sectors, where secure data transmission is crucial.

## 📝 Task Objective

🔹 **Task Title:** Secure File Sharing System  
🔹 **Goal:** To develop a secure file upload and download system using AES encryption, where files are encrypted at the time of upload and decrypted during download.  
🔹 **Project Focus:** Data confidentiality, secure file handling, encryption key protection, and basic frontend-backend integration.

## 🚀 What I Did

1. *Set up a secure Flask application in Python*
2. *Implemented AES encryption* using the PyCryptodome library
3. *Built a web interface* using HTML to allow file upload and download
4. *Encrypted files at rest* and decrypted them during retrieval
5. **Used a .env file** to manage the encryption key securely
6. *Tested file uploads/downloads* and ensured end-to-end security
7. *Documented the entire project* in a professional PDF report with screenshots
